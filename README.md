# GitHub Actions Workflow Setup

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automate various tasks through workflows defined in `.github/workflows/*.yml` files. 

## Requirements

To ensure that the workflows function correctly, please make sure to configure the following settings in the repository:

1. **Workflow Permissions**:  
   - In the repository where the action should run, navigate to `Settings` -> `Actions` (under `General`).
   - Locate `Workflow permissions` and enable **"Read and write permissions"**. This permission is required for workflows that generate or modify files, such as tasks that automate "To-Do" lists.

By following these steps, the workflows in this repository will have the necessary permissions to operate and manage automated tasks effectively.
